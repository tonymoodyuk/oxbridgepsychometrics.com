  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  <p>
    Demonstrating meaningful patient benefit requires more than clinical efficacy.
    We help pharmaceutical organisations capture, quantify, and validate patient experiences
    using scientifically robust psychometric approaches that stand up to regulatory scrutiny.

  <h2>Why Work With Oxbridge Psychometrics</h2>
  <p>
    Our work sits at the intersection of psychometrics, patient-centred research,
    and regulatory science. We understand both the methodological rigor required
    and the practical realities of regulatory review.
  </p>
  <p>
    The result is evidence that is scientifically defensible, clearly communicated,
    and appropriate for decision-making by regulatory authorities.
  </p>
   <p>
    Prof Georgina Jones and Dr Anthony Moody are highly experienced psychometricians who have come together in this recently established business.
    Both completed their doctorates at University of Oxford over 20 years ago and have worked independently as psychometricians. 
    Georgina is the Professor of Health Psychology and Director of the Centre for Patient-Reported Outcomes at the Leeds Beckett University, UK.
