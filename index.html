  <h2>About Oxbridge Psychometrics</h2>
  <p>
    Prof Georgina Jones and Dr Anthony Moody are highly experienced psychometricians who have come together in this recently established business.
    Both completed their doctorates at University of Oxford over 20 years ago and have worked independently as psychometricians. 
    Georgina is the Professor of Health Psychology and Director of the Centre for Patient-Reported Outcomes at the Leeds Beckett University, UK. 
    Anthony was Lead Psychometrician of UK Central Government in the Cabinet Office.
    We are passionate about data-led insights and both recognised that beneficial health development was being slowed by weak demonstration of patient benefit; often because patient questionnaires were poor, data collection and sampling protocols were weak, and scrutiny by application of psychometric techniques was inexpertly applied. 
    Using our knowledge and experience we knew we could do better than the market was providing.
